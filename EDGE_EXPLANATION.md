# What is "Edge" - Simple Explanation

## Quick Answer

**Edge = Fair Probability - Kalshi Price**

- **Fair Probability**: What sportsbooks think the true win probability is (after removing their profit margin)
- **Kalshi Price**: What Kalshi is charging for that bet
- **Edge**: The difference = how much value you're getting

## Example: Burnley vs Crystal Palace

**What you're seeing:**
- **Kalshi Price**: 19.0% (Kalshi charges 19% for "Burnley to win")
- **Fair Probability**: 73.4% (Sportsbooks think Burnley has 73.4% chance to win)
- **Edge**: 73.4% - 19.0% = **54.4%**

**What this means:**
- Sportsbooks think Burnley has a **73.4% chance** to win
- Kalshi is only charging **19%** for that bet
- You're getting **54.4% more value** than you should pay
- This is a **very good bet** (if research confirms Burnley should win)

## Understanding Kalshi Markets

For each game, Kalshi has **separate markets** for each team:

**Example: Burnley vs Crystal Palace**
- **Market 1**: "Burnley to win" → YES price = 19% (means 19% chance Burnley wins)
- **Market 2**: "Crystal Palace to win" → YES price = 55% (means 55% chance Crystal Palace wins)

**Note:** These don't add up to 100% because:
- There's a spread (bid-ask gap)
- There might be a draw/TIE market (which we filter out)
- The markets are independent

## How to Verify You're Looking at the Right Market

**Check these match:**
1. **"Team to Bet"** column should say "Burnley (YES)"
2. **"Kalshi Price"** should be the YES price for Burnley (19%)
3. **"Fair Prob"** should be the fair probability for Burnley (73.4%)

**If they don't match:**
- You might be seeing the opponent's market
- Or the team matching logic failed

## Why Low Kalshi Prices Can Be Good

A low Kalshi price (like 19%) can mean:
1. ✅ **Great opportunity**: Kalshi is undervaluing the team (like Burnley)
2. ❌ **Wrong market**: We're showing the opponent's market by mistake

**How to tell:**
- If Fair Prob is HIGH (73.4%) and Kalshi Price is LOW (19%) = ✅ Good bet
- If Fair Prob is LOW (20%) and Kalshi Price is LOW (19%) = ❌ Wrong market or bad bet

## The Math

**Edge Calculation:**
```
Edge = Fair Probability - Kalshi Price
Edge = 73.4% - 19.0% = 54.4%
```

**Expected Value:**
If you bet $100 at 19% Kalshi price:
- If Burnley wins (73.4% chance): You get $100 back (100% payout)
- Expected value = (73.4% × $100) - $19 = $73.40 - $19 = **$54.40 profit**

This is why a 54.4% edge is excellent!
